\section{Toolsets}

After the MetaPreprocess module, 
the input multiple studies are well prepared and ready for the seven analytical modules in MetaOmics.
By clicking on the ``Toolsets" tab, users can navigate to individual MetaOmics modules.
In the next few subsections, 
we will introduce in details how to run each of these modules.
For each MetaOmics module, 
a summary table of studies and sample sizes is shown on the top left corner. 
There is an ``about" drop-down menu which contains a brief introduction  of the module.
The ``options" drop-down menu contain common options users can select or tune in the analysis.
The ``advanced options" menu contains more technical options which we generally do not recommend users to change unless they are familiar with the methods.
After applying the modules, 
all result files will be automatically saved in the working directory which is specified in Section~\ref{sec:setting}.
For computationally demanding methods, the procedure may take minutes or up to hours depending on size of datasets.
Users can keep track of the progress by checking the R console.
