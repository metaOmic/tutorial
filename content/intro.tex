MetaDE for differential expression analysis,
MetaPath for pathway enrichment analysis,
MetaClust for sparse clustering analysis,
MetaPCA for principal component analysis,
MetaPredict for classification analysis,
MetaNetwork for differential co-expression network analysis,

In this tutorial, 
we will go through installation and usage step by step using real data examples.
