\section{Introduction}
 
MetaOmics is a browser-based software suite for transcriptomic meta-analysis with R shiny-based graphical user interface (GUI).
Many state-of-the-art meta-analysis tools are available in this software,
including %MetaProcess for omics data preprocessing, 
MetaQC for quality control, 
MetaDE for differential expression analysis,
MetaPath for pathway enrichment analysis,
MetaNetwork for differential co-expression network analysis,
MetaPredict for classification analysis,
MetaClust for sparse clustering analysis and 
MetaPCA for principal component analysis.
For detailed explanation of these omics data analysis approaches, 
please refer to (to be updated once the manuscript is accepted).


In this tutorial, 
we will go through the installation and usage of MetaOmics step by step using real data examples.
The MetaOmics software suite is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/metaOmics/metaOmics}.
This tutorial can be found at \url{https://github.com/metaOmics/tutorial/blob/master/metaOmics_turtorial.pdf}.
Each MetaOmics module will be introduced in later sections and the associated R packages are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/metaOmics}.
